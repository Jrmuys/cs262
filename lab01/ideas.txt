One idea is an app that can find class locations on campus to make it easier to find classrooms. 
This would make it much easier to find classrooms and give you the fastest way to get to class 
from any location on campus.

Another idea is to make an app that does a different random thing every time you open it. 
One time it could be an app that shows you all the best cupcake places near you and the next 
it could be a game that requires you to find hedgehogs in a swamp. These would be generated from a list
of core apps, then themes and subjects that could produce some interesting results. Not sure how useful it would
be but it would be cool.
