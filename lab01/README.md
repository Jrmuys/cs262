## node_modules

This folder is the location that npm installs all of the external modules needed to make the app run including the react core that runs the app.

---

## .gitignore

This file contains the files that git will ignore when looking for changes in the program which should include files that should not go on your personal github like private environmental variables (your secrets), the node_modules folder (not your code), and any large files that don't need to be stored on github.
