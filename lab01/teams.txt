    a. I have worked with a javascript application. This past summer I created a website using the Angular framework
     (with typescript) so I am familiar with using a js framework. We briefly used SQLite in CS300 and I used a non-
     sql database with my previously mentioned web app (mongoDB) but I don't have a ton of experience directly with
     sql database systems.
    b. I have used slack extensively for the Calvin Mars Rover Design Team as we do most non-verbal communication through that.
     I use trello for personal organization and also to organize projects for the rover team. I used it to organize tasks that
     had to be done for my website this summer as well. I use git and github for the rover team as well as my large personal projects
     to varying levels of success (and is CS344 last semester).
    c. I would like to work on an app that can help students find their way through campus and find classrooms.
